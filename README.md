# mutation_surfing
Final project for [UC Berkeley](https://www.berkeley.edu/) STAT260, Stochastic Processes in Evolutionary Biology
Taught by [Prof. Yun Song](http://people.eecs.berkeley.edu/~yss/)
Spring 2015 semester

Reproduced some results of the following papers, which study how mutations in populations undergoing range expansion or migration can propagate along the wavefront, even if these mutations adversely affect the fitness of the individuals.

* Klopfstein, Currat, and Excoffier. [The fate of mutations surfing on the wave of a range expansion](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16280540). Mol Biol Evol (2006) vol. 23 (3) 482-90
